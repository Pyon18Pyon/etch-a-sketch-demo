# etch-a-sketch

* There are 16x16 grid of squares in a webpage.
* Using a "hover" effect to change color of the grids when passing mouse over them, leaving a (pixelate) trail through the grid like a pen would.
* There is a button on the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and a pop up appears for a user to type the number of squares per side for the new grid (max 100).
* Once the number is entered, the new grid will be generated.
